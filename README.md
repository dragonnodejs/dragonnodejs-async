# DragonNode.js Async
Framework to develop modular and testable Node.js applications
- Separate configuration and implementation of modules
- Service container to use services from other modules or define new services in the modules
- Allow to mock libraries and services for testing modules as independent units
- Group modules to bundles and share them with other developers
- Support asynchronously modules and bundles
